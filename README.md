## 🚀 Overview

This website is a **developer portfolio reimagined as a terminal interface**. It offers an interactive way for visitors to learn about my skills, projects, and background by "running commands" in a simulated shell environment.

Unlike traditional portfolios, this project engages users with a retro-aesthetic while leveraging modern web technologies for performance and accessibility.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Interactive Terminal**: Fully functional command-line interface simulation.
- **Typing Effects**: Realistic text rendering animations.
- **Command System**: extensible command parser supporting `help`, `whois`, `projects`, and more.
- **SEO Optimized**: Built with `react-helmet-async` for full social graph and search engine visibility despite the dynamic UI.
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML hidden behind the canvas of the terminal for screen readers.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile (with adapted virtual keyboard/input).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: [React](https://reactjs.org/) (Create React App)
- **Styling**: Javascript-driven animations & CSS Variables for theming.
- **Icons**: [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- **Movement/Animation**: Custom hooks & Framer Motion
- **SEO**: `react-helmet-async` & JSON-LD Structured Data
